# Model Efficiency & Diminishing Returns Analysis
## Marginal ROAS and Optimal Budget Allocation by Client

---

## Executive Summary

**Analysis Objective:** Determine optimal budget allocation between Meta and TikTok for each client by analyzing spend vs. revenue curves, marginal ROAS, and saturation points.

**Key Finding:** All three clients should maintain balanced allocation with minor adjustments based on marginal efficiency rather than major platform shifts.

---

## Methodology: Marginal ROAS Calculation

### Mathematical Framework
```
Marginal ROAS = 풊Revenue / 풊Spend
Where 풊 = incremental change in weekly spend levels

Saturation Point = When Marginal ROAS < Target ROAS (1.5x)
Optimal Allocation = Equalize marginal ROAS across platforms
```

### Data Analysis Approach
1. **Spend Quartile Analysis:** Divided weekly spend into quartiles to identify performance at different investment levels
2. **Revenue Response Curves:** Fitted logarithmic curves to model diminishing returns
3. **Marginal Efficiency:** Calculated incremental ROAS for each $1,000 spend increase
4. **Saturation Detection:** Identified spending levels where efficiency drops below profitable thresholds
