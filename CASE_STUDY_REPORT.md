# Budget Optimization Case Study Report
## TikTok vs Meta Performance Analysis

---

## SLIDE 1: Executive Summary & Business Question

### Business Challenge
**"One of our clients is concerned that their spend on TikTok is not delivering results comparable to Meta."**

### Key Question Answered
**Should we reallocate budget from TikTok to Meta, or optimize within current allocation?**

### Bottom Line Recommendation
**MAINTAIN CURRENT 50/50 BUDGET ALLOCATION** - TikTok performance is comparable to Meta across all clients.

### Evidence Summary
- **TikTok ROAS:** 5.0-5.6x vs **Meta ROAS:** 5.3-5.7x (only 6.6% difference)
- **Both platforms:** Significantly exceed target ROAS of 1.5x
- **Risk-adjusted returns:** Similar performance consistency
- **Opportunity:** Within-platform optimization over reallocation

## SLIDE 2: Analysis Approach & Methodology

### Data Foundation
- **12 months** of weekly campaign performance
- **3 clients** across **2 platforms** (Meta & TikTok)
- **936 campaign records** with complete funnel metrics

### 5-Step Analysis Framework

#### 1. Performance Metrics Calculation
**Prioritized:** ROAS as primary KPI, supported by CTR, CVR, CPC, CPA
**Why:** ROAS directly measures revenue efficiency per dollar spent

#### 2. Client-Platform Aggregation
**Prioritized:** Total spend/revenue by client-platform combinations
**Why:** Eliminates weekly volatility, shows true performance levels

#### 3. Return Curves Analysis
**Prioritized:** Marginal ROAS and saturation detection
**Why:** Identifies optimal spend levels and diminishing returns

#### 4. Funnel Diagnosis
**Prioritized:** CTR vs CVR breakdown to isolate performance drivers
**Why:** Determines if issues are creative (CTR) or targeting/product (CVR)

#### 5. Creative Performance
**Prioritized:** Ad concept performance across platforms
**Why:** Links to creative strategy and cross-platform learning opportunities

### Key Methodology Decisions
- **Aggregated weekly data** to remove noise
- **Used total ROAS** rather than average to weight by spend
- **Applied 1.5x ROAS threshold** as minimum performance benchmark
- **Focused on actionable metrics** that teams can directly optimize
